This NOTAM is for describe the whazzup file retrieved.

!GENERAL

The general section contains some general settings.
They are:

VERSION : it's a integer number stating the data file format release. It will be incremented every time the data format will change

RELOAD : it's time in minutes network-data.txt file will be updated. There is no need to download the file with an interval less than this value, because the file will be updated only with this frequency.

UPDATE : it's the last date and time network-data.txt file has been updated. Format is: yyyymmddhhnnss. You should check that this data/time read is more recent that the last data/time read by your previous download, and you should consider data only if this data/time is more recent. This is to avoid using data downloaded from not synchronized (outdated) servers. Eventually you can try to download data from a different server if this data/time is less recent than the last read.

CONNECTED CLIENTS : it's the number of clients currently connected. This includes all clients connected, also observers.


!CLIENTS

This section contains all data related to all clients connected.
Each client connected is on its own record (row) ending with CR+LF, and all fields are separated by ":" character (without quotes).

If the client changes its atis after this date/time the data server will have an older atis. To retrieve the most updated atis you need to use the function present at the url shown by "atis0" parameter in the status.txt file.

S Scheduled Services 
N Non-Scheduled Services 
G General Aviation 
M Military 
X Other
